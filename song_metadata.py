def add_metadata(fingerprints):
    """Creates a dictionary of all user-inputted metadata

    Prompts the user to input known metadata (song title, artist, and 
    genre). Compiles the user-inputted information into a dictionary of 
    metadata and returns the dictionary.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    fingerprints : int, number of fingerprints associated with the song

    Returns
    -------
    dict
    keys = metadata category (title, artist, genre)
    values = metadata provided via user input

    Notes
    -------
    This function prompts the user to input metadata in the following order:
    song title, artist, genre. For each category, this function asks the
    user if they would like to input a value. If an unknown response is 
    received, the function will keep prompting the user for a maximum of 5 
    times before moving on. If the user chooses to input a value, the 
    function will prompt the user to enter the value.
