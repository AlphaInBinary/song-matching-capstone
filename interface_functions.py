"""Interface Database Functions
saving and loading the database

inspecting the list of songs (and perhaps artists) that exist in the database

providing the ability to switch databases (optional)

deleting a song from a database (optional)

guarding against the adding the same song to the database multiple times (optional)

Parameters
---------------
metadata = a dictionary with {song ID: [Title: song_title, Name: song_name, Genre : genre_name] }
database = a dictionary with parameter fingerprints (key): list of song IDs
matchdatabase = a dictionary with {song ID: fingerprints}
