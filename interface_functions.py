"""Interface Database Functions
saving and loading the database

inspecting the list of songs (and perhaps artists) that exist in the database

providing the ability to switch databases (optional)

deleting a song from a database (optional)

guarding against the adding the same song to the database multiple times (optional)

Parameters
---------------
metadata = a dictionary with {song ID: [Title: song_title, Name: song_name, Genre : genre_name] }
database = a dictionary with parameter fingerprints (key): list of song IDs
matchdatabase = a dictionary with {song ID: fingerprints}

    ------------
    Uses the Fast Fourier Transform to process the recorded audio data, which

    in the recording. These fingerprints, and the times in which they occur
    in the recording are compared to the existing database of songs and the 
    best match is displayed for the user.
